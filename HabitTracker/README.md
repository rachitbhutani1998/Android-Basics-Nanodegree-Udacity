#Habit Tracker App
------------------------------
This habit tracker app is the nineth project of Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree.

This application stores the data in the database of the phone. It uses the concepts of SQLite of creating a table and thus maintaining the daatabase in the storage so that it appears same when the user runs the app ever again after saving some data in it.

The app offers to insert some dummy data which contains not so relevant data about a dummy habit. As soon as the user inserts some dummy data, the data gets stored in the database and can be retrieved anytime from the app later on. The data gets appended into a single TextView as we continue to insert data in the database.
