#Tour Guide App
------------------
This guide application is the sixth project in Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree.

This app was made to implement the concept of custom ArrayAdapter and custom Object Class with a ListView.

The 5 list views are populated with restaurants, clubs, hotels, cinemas and some tourist spots in city Chandigarh.

The list item also has a ClickListener applied to it which shows the exact location of the list item.

The application throws an intent to the maps to search for that specific location on the maps on which the ser clicked on.
