#Score Keeper App
-----------------
This is the 2nd project in the Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree.
It can be used to count goals and fouls during a football match.

The two buttons(Goal and Foul for each team) for each team are used to increase the number of goals and fouls to keep the record of the match.
The reset button sets all the TextViews(Goals and Fouls for both teams) to default i.e. the values to 0.
