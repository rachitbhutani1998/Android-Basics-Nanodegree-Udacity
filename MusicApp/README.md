#Musical Structure App
------------------------------
This musical structure app is the fourth project of Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree.
Note that the app is not programmed to run music files by any means.

The application allows you to access multiple activities like the homepage of music player from which you can access different activities where you can see your currently playing track, the playlist you saved, a list of all tracks and albums in your mobile device.

The application uses OnClickListener to access different activities from different buttons in every activity.

Every child activity displays a TextView which shows the role of the activity in a MusicPlayer.
