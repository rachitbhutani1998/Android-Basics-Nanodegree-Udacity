#Quiz App
-------------------------
This quiz application is the third project of Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree.

The application asks you five easy questions, some to choose an option(using a radio button), some to choose more than one(using a checkbox) and some to enter your response by text(a textfield to record the response) and if you got all the answers right, you will get an appreciation snackbar displaying your score which you can share with your friends and others.

You can download and install the quiz app by clicking [here](https://doc-0c-1g-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/o2tgk2qv7cfcunpop37jvk16eg2d3hca/9gfliglfm4b4sk2fpdpuk7nftc29jnnk/1502632800000/00245966288557929305/16589266254584406468/0By1gotVqYBcyU1NSMTlQeTBPOHM?e=download&nonce=f40s274tq1ppk&user=16589266254584406468&hash=u6482p4ihfchpnfjqrdgi94tu862q8qm).
